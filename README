# Siχtus

An overgrown static blog generator

Siχtus is the preprocessor is use to generate my personal site, it's been in
development since 2007 to serve my personal needs and now it goes public. I do
not expect it to be used by anyone else, really, but at least the existence of
this public release should push me to keep it stable, instead of changing
everything and breaking compatibility with each new version.

# TODO

Would you like Siχtus to do something else? Try asking, I'm open to suggestion.

- Reintroducing tag support in pages, the tag cloud and tag search from v0.9?
- Configuration support for additional custom CSS files, JS scripts, other
  stuff…
- Bring back voices support
- Of all the TIDs on a page, the current one should be highlighted. The current
  tab, if any, is the last element of $d[0]; a JS script may be able to take
  care of this;
